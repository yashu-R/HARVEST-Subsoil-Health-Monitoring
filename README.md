# A-Smart-Nail-Platform-for-Wireless-Subsoil-Health-Monitoring-via-UAV-Assisted-RF-Interrogation

Monitoring subsoil conditions with high precision across large agricultural areas is critical for optimizing farm management, minimizing resource waste, and supporting sustainable crop production. However, most existing soil sensing technologies rely on battery-powered or active electronic components that are prone to failure, require regular maintenance, and are challenging to scale in fields with significant spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, these systems often disrupt the natural soil environment, limiting their viability for long-term deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce HARVEST (Hybrid Antenna for RF-Enhanced Volumetric Water Content and Electrical Conductivity-Based Soil Tracking)—a low-cost, electronic-free wireless sensing platform for subsoil health monitoring. HARVEST employs nail-shaped passive probes physically and electrically connected to concentric circular split-ring resonators (SRRs) mounted above the soil. This architecture minimizes RF signal attenuation by keeping the radiating elements aboveground, enabling efficient backscatter communication with a drone-mounted reader. Subsurface variations in soil properties—such as dielectric constant and ionic conductivity—are transduced into measurable changes in capacitance or resistance by the buried nail probes. These changes modulate the SRR antenna’s resonance characteristics, resulting in frequency and amplitude shifts that can be wirelessly detected. The system was optimized through full-wave electromagnetic simulations to refine probe geometry and SRR configuration for enhanced sensitivity and readout range. The platform was fabricated and validated through laboratory testing under varying soil conditions and interrogation distances. For proof of concept, HARVEST was deployed in a cornfield and interrogated using a custom-built UAV-based RF reader during an entire crop growth cycle. The sensor successfully tracked subsoil volumetric water content (3.7–23.5%) and electrical conductivity (0.2–0.6 dS/m), demonstrating linear sensitivities of 9.45 MHz/% for VWC and 4.34 dB/dS/m for EC, with reliable wireless readability up to 1.8 meters. By eliminating onboard electronics and enabling wide-area aerial interrogation, HARVEST represents a scalable, energy-efficient solution for real-time subsoil monitoring. It offers significant potential for advancing precision agriculture and promoting sustainable farming practices worldwide.
