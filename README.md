# A-Smart-Nail-Platform-for-Wireless-Subsoil-Health-Monitoring-via-UAV-Assisted-RF-Interrogation

Monitoring subsoil conditions is essential for precision agriculture, yet most soil sensors depend on batteries or active electronics that limit longevity, scalability, and field deployment. We present HARVEST (Hybrid Antenna for RF-Enhanced Volumetric Water Content and Electrical Conductivity-Based Soil Tracking), a fully passive, low-cost wireless sensing platform that overcomes these constraints. HARVEST integrates nail-shaped probes with concentric split-ring resonators positioned aboveground, reducing RF attenuation and enabling efficient UAV-based backscatter interrogation. Subsurface dielectric and conductivity variations modulate the SRR resonance through capacitance and resistance changes in the buried probes, producing measurable frequency and amplitude shifts. The system was optimized through full-wave simulations, fabricated on FR-4, and validated in both laboratory soils and a cornfield deployment. HARVEST reliably tracked 3.7–23.5% VWC and 0.2–0.6 dS/m EC with sensitivities of 9.45 MHz/% and 4.34 dB/dS/m, maintaining wireless readability up to 1.8 m. By eliminating onboard electronics and enabling wide-area UAV interrogation, HARVEST provides a scalable, energy-efficient approach for real-time subsoil monitoring and next-generation precision agriculture.
